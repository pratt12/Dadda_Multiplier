# Dadda_Multiplier
The Design, Simulation and Schematic Generation of the 4x4 bit Dadda Multiplier was done as a part of great initiative: [Mixed Signal Hackathon organised by FOSSEE IIT Bombay](https://esim.marathoniitb.in/home). It has been a pain point for semiconductor industry as well as us students, the lack of practice and hands on training projects. The hackathon took place on eSim and Makerchip giving a great exposure for digital hardware design to me.

## Introduction
The speed of multiplier circuits affects the performance of digital systems and so it is very important to develop better algorithms for faster, more efficient processing and Dadda multiplier is one of the fastest ways of implementing a multiplier.Dadda multipliers are generally more gate efficient than their Wallace counterparts

This is the reduction methodology as used in the multiplier circuit.

The full adder module implementation

## Schematic Representation
Due to the constraints of Makerchip's acceptance of only one other module other than the top module, the half adders were also implemented using full adder itself.
